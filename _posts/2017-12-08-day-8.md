Aww damn, I missed one. Coded a few lines, but I was out and about for most of yesterday. Been continuing the 3-count pushups tho.

Today I did more work on the GUI aspects of my game, but didn't get too far. I've been toying with giving the game a very limited color palette, and chose this nice one.

My main issue now is updating the GUI in one script, by triggering it from another, with data from a third. It's not difficult, just messy. I really just need to spend more time designing it on paper, remembering my object-oriented design principles, that kind of thing. In conjunction with the GUI scripts, I've implemented a very rudimentary Action Point system. A player may take 4 actions before they must end their turn. Right now, all they can do is move around the map and reveal new tiles.

Next steps are adding unique features to tiles, spawning robbers at random tiles at the end of a turn, etc.
