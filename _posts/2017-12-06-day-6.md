Real short today,

With the basics of the Tile system complete, I wanted to dive into GUIs (graphical user interface, the text and panels and buttons). Watched a bunch of Unity tutorial videos on the GUI system, and learned about their canvas and anchoring system. That was new and interesting, learning how the UI can stretch or move depending on how you anchor it to the canvas.

So I started to add some UI elements, panels and text. Easy, with what I learned earlier. A left anchored panel to display total income, public opinion, crime rate, etc. A right anchored panel to display specific info about a single tile. But then I had to try manipulating that text through scripts. Which proved difficult.

You see, Unity decided to update how they manage UI elements a few years back. However, the vast majority of online information was written before this update. So, that's where I am. Looking for the proper way to reference the text off a UI element from within a script.

Meh.



Oh ya, to go along with the Devember coding challenge, I'm also giving myself a fitness challenge. 1 more pushup per day of December, counting to 3 at the top and bottom. That is all.
