Well shoot. I did a bit of work on the 10th, but forgot to make a post. And just stalled out on the 11th. Played way too much Neon Chrome. Tho the pushups still happened.

But, I put in extra hours today getting the enemy system working in my game! Tiles are created with a spawn rate. At the end of a turn, I run through the list of revealed tiles, and randomly spawn criminals on them. There is also a chance that the criminal can move between tiles. Thankfully I had the tile flipping and player movement scripts to reference here and had criminals running around my city on just my second try! First time, I forgot to add a break statement to the movement randomization, so criminals were just moving back and forth.

I also fiddled more with Unity UI stuff, learning about the colorblock object. A selectable UI element doesn't just have a color property, it has a colorblock. The color block then contains the colors for each state of the element: normal, highlighted, selected, and disabled.

The enemy system still needs some work: catching crooks, effects on tile income, etc. But first, I want to let the player select and see details about tiles. A job for tomorrow!
