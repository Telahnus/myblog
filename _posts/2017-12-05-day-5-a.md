## Check It Out!!

![Screencap from Unity]({{ "/assets/ld40-screencap-1.png" | absolute_url }})

So after supper and breaks for gaming, I added keyboard movement for the player token (little blue dude). When you move onto a blank tile (the darker grey ones), it will flip and spawn as described before. The main issues I had were with keeping all the proper references as positions and objects were updated, added, or replaced. After getting all that sorted out, I decided to spend a few minutes updating the prefabs of the tiles; giving them raised borders, changing colors, etc.

System complete!
