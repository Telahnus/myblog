# Hello, World!

Today is Day 1 of [Devember](devember.org), an excuse to program and blog every day of the month. The official self-enforced contract is as follows:

> I, Telahnus, will participate to the next Devember. My Devember will be to build a full portfolio website and game demo. I promise I will program for my Devember for at least an hour, every day of the next December. I will also write a daily public devlog and will make the produced code publicly available on the internet. No matter what, I will keep my promise. 

Not too bad, eh? Well we are kicking things off with [Ludum Dare](ldjam.com) 40! Running right now, until Monday 10pm (at least for me).

But first things first. Setting up this dev-blog. I'm trying out the [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com), a static site generator, to help create my blog, and [Github Pages](pages.github.com) to host it. It has already been a long and arduous process, but I mainly followed this [article](https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages). I'll try going into more detail about it tomorrow.
